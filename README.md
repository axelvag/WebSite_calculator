# WebSite_calculator

> An calculator site "+ - * /"

## Objective

The goal of this project is to combine the three Web programming languages: HTML, CSS and PHP. The objectives are:
- take charge of web programming tools: a terminal, an editor, a browser, a web server and the development tools provided by the browser,
- design a simple static page in HTML,
- apply a CSS style sheet to a web page,
- understand the role of the local browser and the remote web server, observe the interactions between them,
- insert a form into the page to perform actions that will be executed by small PHP programs,
- manipulate form variables.
To achieve these objectives, I created a minimal calculator that allows you to enter two numbers and an operation to perform between these two numbers and then display the result.
